# Simulated-OS
Simulate an operating system to implement process and memory management
Phase 1 deals with Process management by implementing 4 scheduling algorithms: First come first serve(FCFS), Shortest job first(SJF), Non preemptive priority and Round robin(RR).
Phase 2 involves Memory management and implements, first fit, best fit and worst fit algorithms.
